june 8th 2025:
- some changes on the design.md and todo.md file
- added fog (duh)
- new recipes!! splitter silo furnace assembler, i think those existed before but didnt have recipes yet. silo is new tho. i deicded to add that quickly cos i realized a chest isn't very automatable. a silo is a 3x3 structure with a 6*6 inventory. a chest is a 1x1 structure with a 3*3 inventory
- frustum culling (fuck that dude i hate that so much but it's there now with 4 layers of stolen code)
- added the silo yeah
- added sky box colour!
- changed to double precision
- made ui come closer
- added info about rendering to the debug ui like triangle count and rendered chunks and render time 
- multi threaded chunk loading and remeshing
- some other colour changes
